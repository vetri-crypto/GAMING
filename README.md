GAMING PROGRAM:
I Developed a Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is repeatedly prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. It also tracks and displays the number of attempts taken to arrive at the correct guess. Use the Random class for number generation and Scanner for user input.
